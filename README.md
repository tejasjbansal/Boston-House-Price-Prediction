# Boston House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
In this project, I have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First, I have explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. Then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enables me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I have tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.
At the end we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework.
